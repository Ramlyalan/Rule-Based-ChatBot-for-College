# Project: KARUNYA UNIVERSITY RULE-BASED CHATBOT

## Description for README

This is a **Flask-based rule-based chatbot application** designed specifically for Karunya University. It answers student-related FAQs by matching input keywords and patterns to provide detailed, meaningful responses about the campus, hostel, faculty, sports facilities, and more. The project integrates:

- **Flask** as a lightweight web framework
- **HTML/CSS/JS** for a clean user interface with voice input/output capability
- **Python Regex** for pattern matching in queries
- **Images** to enhance visual responses (e.g. hostel photos, campus views)
- **Evaluation metrics calculation** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score) for project analysis

This chatbot helps students and visitors interactively explore university information while demonstrating a practical NLP application with an elegant UI and backend integration.
